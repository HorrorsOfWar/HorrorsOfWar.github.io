								The Impacts of the Vietnam War on Vietnamese Children
							</h2>
							<img class="left" src="images/war.jpg" width="225" alt="" />
							<p>
                The period of time and location that a child is born in decided their fate
                and for the unfortunate who were born in Vietnam around the mid 1900s, their fate
                was to survive through the harsh and dangerous time period, known as the Vietnam
                War.<br>The challenges that they were forced to face had been numerous in number,
                including air raids, the risk of being killed by soldiers, napalm and
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange#:~:text=Agent%20Orange%20is%20a%20herbicide,War%20from%201961%20to%201971" target="_blank">
                harmful chemicals</a> released by mainly the US forces. Their education was
                a major issue as houses and schools were bombed and as a result, many children became
                homeless and their schools had to often change locations or be held at night to
                avoid becoming a target of heavy bombings. Some schools resorted to building bamboo
                and palm leaf cottages in forests as their school.<br>
                <img src="images/school at night.png" alt="A drawing of Vietnames students going to school at night." width="350"><br>
                <i>'Going to school at night' (Đi học đêm) by Phi Tiến Sơn, 12 years old. Việt Nam, no.154, 1971 p. [14]. British Library, SU 216(2)</i><br>
                As a result, the Vietnam War severely damaged both their physical and mental health. The
                heavy chemicals (including Agent Orange and other herbicides) damaged their organs and
                trauma that came with it caused irreversible mental damage. <br>
                Despite hardships, the children had not given up the will to live, in fact, their
                powerful will to live gave them the courage to fight, for themselves, for their families
                and for the country. The Vietnamese Communist Party and the National Liberal Front (Viet Cong)
                had inspired young ones to fight their enemies and to serve the country in a
                struggle to reunite Vietnam and to regain peace. A resulting action was the attempted
                assassination of the US Secretary of Defence,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara" target="_blank">Robert McNamara</a>
                in May 1963. This was attempted by
                a young electrician named <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_V%C4%83n_Tr%E1%BB%97i">
                Nguyễn Văn Trỗi</a> However, Trỗi did not succeed in his plan and was sentenced to death
                and was executed by a firing squad in Saigon on 15 October 1964.<br><img src="images/Nguyễn Văn Trỗi.png" alt="A black and white photograph of Nguyễn Văn Trỗi about to be executed." width="350"><br>
                <i>Execution of Nguyễn Văn Trỗi. Việt Nam, no.149, 1970 p. 31. British Library, SU216(2)</i><br>
                Some children as young as 13 were even setting foot on the brutal battlefield of the
                Vietnam War. These reckless young guerrillas learnt to fight their enemies, and killed
                both American and South Vietnamese soldiers. An example of this 
                The damage that the Vietnam War had caused to their bodies were permanent and left eternal scars that they would never
                forget.
