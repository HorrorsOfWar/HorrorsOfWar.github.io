                The Vietnam War, which began in 1954, was a long and costly conflict between the communist government of North Vietnam and South Vietnam (known as the Viet Cong) and its allies.<br><br>
                The war took over 3 million lives, which included more than 58,000 Americans, 1.1 million Viet Cong and North Vietnamese soldiers, approximately 521 Australians and more than half of the 3 million lives were Vietnamese civilians. U.S forces were forced to withdraw in 1973 due to the long and harsh battle. The war ended in 1975 with communist North Vietnam gaining control of South Vietnam and the country was unified as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam the following year.
